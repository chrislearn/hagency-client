# Hagency Desktop

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Hagency Desktop is a native Rust/Makepad client for Hagency servers. It combines
Matrix chat, Project workspaces and locally executed AI Agents in one application.
Sign in to a **Hagency server** through its Pasion browser authorization. Ordinary
Matrix servers are not supported by the current login flow.

## What is managed where

- A Project binds one Matrix Space. Its discussion Rooms keep their own membership.
- An Agent is a permanent, server-wide identity owned by its creator. Creation
  assigns the current authorized device; Room bindings are separate.
- The server checks identity, Room admission and the assigned execution device.
  Project/Room administrators manage Agent access and service pauses.
- The owner selects Codex, model, workspace, budgets and tool policy on their own
  device. These resource choices require no server administrator approval.
- One device can run multiple Agents. Switching accounts stops the current owner
  runtime; it does not transfer Agents or merge account data.

## Quick start

1. Enter your Hagency server address and complete Pasion sign-in in the browser.
   The same authorization establishes your Matrix chat and owner-management session.
2. Open **Projects → New Project** (also available from the Projects **⋯** menu).
   Create a Space or select a joined Space. Add discussion Rooms from its details.
3. Open **Agents → New Agent**, enter a name, and wait for the identity and its
   owner private chat to become ready. No Project or Room is required to create it.
4. In **Codex**, choose **Use my signed-in local Codex account**. An
   already signed-in local account does not require another login. Alternatively,
   use the separate Codex sign-in controls. Choose and save a model and workspace.
5. Set the Agent, Room and requester limits in **Budgets**. Then select
   the private chat or a bound Room in **Run**, explicitly choose
   estimated accounting and a reservation, and start that Room.

See the [full native quick-start guide](docs/hagency-quickstart.md) for Room
bindings, member invitations, policy boundaries and recovery states.

Project tabs are **Overview / Rooms / Members / Access**. Agent tabs are
**Agent / Codex / Budgets / Run**, for identity/device, local resources, request
policy and quota, and scoped execution/approvals respectively.

## Navigation and retained features

The desktop sidebar has **Projects, Agents, Chats, Contacts and Mini apps**.
Projects, Agents and Chats each have a **⋯** creation menu. **More** opens Discover,
Explore rooms, Moments, File Transfer, Article editor, Browser and Settings.
Project entries have their own **⋯** menu for details, Rooms, members, invitations
and opening the Space. Invitation controls follow actual Matrix permissions.

Matrix chat, contacts, room search and attachments, encrypted human conversations,
Moments, the native article editor and scoped mini-app import/consent/run remain.
The default mini-app catalog has no Palpo app. Hagency management uses the native
Projects and Agents pages; the former Palpo resource/coordinator workflow is retired.
Agent encrypted-Room execution is deferred; this does not remove Matrix chat crypto.

The renderer remains experimental; arbitrary WeChat HTML import and complete
WeChat compatibility are not claimed. See the [article integration evidence](lab/article-html-integration/README.md).

## Accounts, settings and local data

Use **Settings → Account** and its saved-account picker to add or switch identities.
The bottom-left account menu opens account settings and logout. Each account keeps
its own Matrix device/crypto data and owner profile. Only the selected account syncs.
Switching stops local Agent processing for the previous account; logout stops its
runtime and revokes its current authorizations.

**Settings** contains **Account, Preferences, Privacy and About**. Appearance and
language are in Preferences. Generic external **Agent Access** controls are separate
from Hagency's native Agents; a BotFather or loopback endpoint is not required for
Hagency setup.

`HAGENCY_DESKTOP_DATA_DIR` selects an absolute, isolated data directory. Existing
`RINX_DATA_DIR` and `ROBRIX_DATA_DIR` environment aliases remain in the desktop
launcher. They do not enable compatibility with retired Fleet data. Owner ledgers,
workspaces and provider associations stay scoped to the full authenticated account.
Moving execution to another device does not move ownership or reset historical
costs; restore the same owner's complete ledger when the recovery gate requires it.

## Build and check

Use the configured checkout with the sibling `hagency-client` owner-engine source
available; the Cargo manifest depends on it. The repository pins Rust 1.98.0.
Install CMake and the platform's native build dependencies, then run:

```sh
cargo run --locked --bin rinx
cargo test --locked --lib
cargo test --locked --manifest-path crates/article-core/Cargo.toml
python3 tools/wechat-ux/check_i18n.py
```

The Cargo package/binary retains the name `rinx`; the application presents itself
as Hagency. Default features use the standalone native application. The retired
`agent_chat` instrumentation is not needed to enable current Project/Agent management.
Mobile packaging requires platform signing and device validation.

Built-in native and OctoScript apps are declared in `system-apps.json`; the article
editor is under `apps/article-editor/`. See the [app development guide](apps/README.md)
and [catalog architecture](docs/adr/0008-rinx-system-app-catalog.md).
