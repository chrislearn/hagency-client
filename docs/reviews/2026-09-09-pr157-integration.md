# PR 157 integration after review closure

The operator requested merging the conflict-free open PRs. Hagency PR 157 at
36631ddd is the only reviewed open Hagency PR that merges without conflict into
local master 49cfee5. GitHub merged it as 7f61fcd on 2026-09-10 at 00:22 UTC
(September 9 locally). Its production delta updates Hono to 4.13.7 and Morgan to
1.12.0, preserving the existing advisory baseline and allowlist.

The isolated integration starts at 49cfee5 and merges the original PR history
without rewriting its published commits. A fresh root and console npm install
uses this worktree's own dependencies. No live service is changed.

The newer local spec inventory correctly rejected the PR's nonexistent
manual_test_dependency_advisory_ratchet selector. Integration moves the registry
audit into an explicit mandatory constraint and keeps all four real Vitest
scenario bindings. This does not replace the external audit with a mock: the
actual npm run audit:baseline command completes with exit zero and no new
advisories. Existing recorded debt remains untriaged.

Validation:

- MCP task routing, Matrix approval and advisory-policy tests: 22 passed in three
  files.
- Native agent-spec parses/lints the contract. Its boundary check passes; four
  Node scenarios skip, so the native lifecycle remains non-passing. Actual Vitest
  and registry verification results are recorded separately.
- `npm run verify:ci` passes with 483 executable bindings and 505 kernel/CLI
  tests. Optional live probes skip without a selected runtime. The first setup
  attempt lacked console dependencies; the next caught the invalid manual
  selector described above. Both causes are corrected before the successful run.

Hagency PRs 154, 155, 156 and 158 conflict with the local review fixes and remain
outside this integration. Palpo PRs 377, 375, 372 and 360 are conflict-free against
their upstream main, but the current GitHub account has only READ permission in
palpo-im/palpo. No upstream Palpo merge is claimed. PR 374 has conflicts and a
failed Complement check; PR 349 also conflicts.

Raw commands, verification logs, PR state and merge receipts are retained under
<local-evidence>/hagency-review-closure/2026-09-09/pr157-merge/. The operator's
independent website coordination changes remain outside the integration commits.
