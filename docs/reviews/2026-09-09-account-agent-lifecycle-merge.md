# Account and Agent lifecycle commit and merge

The operator requested committing and merging the account and Agent workflow
changes. Hagency implementation commit is `1e2d279`; Palpo Web implementation
commit is `3d63ae11`. Palpo's local `main` was fast-forwarded to its implementation.
Hagency was merged with the existing local `master` in the isolated
`integration/agent-lifecycle-20260909` worktree. Its two conflicts were additive
coordination-document sections; both parents' contents were retained. All
application, test, specification and script files match the tested feature
commit. Website documentation edits from the primary workspace remain separate.

## Included work

- Palpo ordinary-account requests, private administrator approvals through
  Robrix, registration recovery, project readiness and deployment configuration.
- Chinese Agent display names with unchanged scoped ASCII runtime identities.
- Verified project room labels and durable revoke response reconciliation.
- Final-allocation Agent retirement through outbound Palpo requests: local stop,
  admission fencing, exact identity deactivation, all-room departure, denied AS
  authentication, duplicate management-record retirement and preserved history.

The initial Hagency CI run found two integration issues. The static route check
could not inspect the extracted stop handler; the HTTP route now explicitly
retains its local guard, and the shared handler retains its independent guard.
The SQLite check incorrectly treated the separate bridge transport inbox as a
router database consumer. Its two exact owners (store and legacy migration test)
are now documented and checked separately. All router internal imports remain
forbidden, including from these owners; an unrelated SQLite consumer is still
rejected. No storage implementation or schema changed for this correction.

## Validation

- Final `npm run verify:ci`: passed, including 505 kernel/CLI tests in 45 files,
  syntax, undefined identifiers, remote packaging, dependency/architecture
  boundaries, router types/build, Agent Operations contract and 470 spec bindings.
- Affected Hagency regression set: 190 tests in 15 files passed, covering Unicode,
  project labels, allocation, stop/revoke, bridge roster, direct conversations and
  outbound inbox durability. Counts overlap the CI kernel and are not summed.
- New exact dependency-boundary test: 1 passed; its 3 unrelated file tests were
  excluded by the title selector and are not claimed as executed in that run.
- Palpo Node suite: 71 passed with zero failures/skips. All four isolated
  Playwright scripts and syntax checks passed.
- Native agent-spec1.4: parse/lint and explicit boundary check ran. Its two Node
  behavioral scenarios remain Skip; native lifecycle is non-passing. Exact
  Vitest results are separate evidence.
- CI's optional live multi-side and Agent E2E scripts skipped without a configured
  runtime. This merge performed no live Agent creation, service restart or new
  retirement. Earlier deployment acceptance remains in its own reports.
- Staged files were checked for known runtime secrets and private database/config
  artifacts; none were included. Patch hygiene passed.

Both origin refs were fetched for inspection. This is a local branch merge;
there was no push. Palpo's newly fetched upstream Rust namespace commit
`62fa8566` is outside this Web integration and remains unmerged into local `main`.
The native homeserver's deployed image remains unchanged.

Logs, original dirty-document snapshots and restoration fragments are preserved
outside Git under
`<local-evidence>/palpo-admin-e2e/2026-09-06/commit-merge-20260909/`.
The source checkout has no provisioned task-writer; no canonical task transition
was invented.
