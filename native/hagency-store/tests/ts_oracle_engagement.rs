//! TS oracle: `tests/engagement-store.test.js`, `tests/engagement-binding.test.js`,

//! `tests/api-engagement-room-admission.test.js`,
//! `tests/api-engagement-side-budget.test.js`.
//!
//! Each case names the TS case it ports. The native surface is
//! `hagency_store::DomainRepository`'s engagement lifecycle (`admit`, `approve`,
//! `reject`, `revoke`) and the offer book reads (`offer_book`, `contributions`,
//! `preview`).
//!
//! Native DELIBERATELY differs from TS in one documented place: native has no
//! offer-terms table, no whitelist and no binding table, and never auto-joins —
//! every engagement is born `pending` and only an operator verdict moves it
//! (`native/hagency-store/src/domain/offer_book.rs:1-33`). Cases whose whole
//! point is the TS auto-join ladder are therefore `ignored` with that reason,
//! never silently dropped.
