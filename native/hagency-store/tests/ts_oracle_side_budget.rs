//! TS-oracle tests for `tests/api-engagement-side-budget.test.js` and
//! `tests/api-agent-project-side-binding.test.js` (board #63).
//!
//! Both files describe a per-SIDE world: a project side is a billing and
//! trust boundary, a per-side allocation gates admission, and an agent is
//! BOUND to exactly one side. Native has no such world — there is no
//! per-side allocation column, no agent↔side binding field, and no
//! auto-join (every engagement is born `pending` and only an operator verdict
//! moves it). So the two families land as parity gaps; the ONE behaviour they
//! share with native — an unknown engagement answers 404 on the verdict path,
//! not a budget refusal — is asserted green.
