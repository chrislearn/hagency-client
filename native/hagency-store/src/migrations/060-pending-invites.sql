-- Task #12: pending invitations to agents (TS bridge-matrix.js
-- state.pendingInvites, 2391-2455, + backend-v2.js:10813-10855 routes).
-- One row per (room, agent). 'declined' is REMEMBERED so the invite poll
-- cannot resurrect it; 'accepted' records that the join has happened.
-- `inviter` is NULL when the invite state named no sender — surfaced,
-- never guessed, because the inviter IS the owner (ADR-002) and inventing
-- one would forge ownership. `mode` is the TS binding's direct/group
-- (from is_direct); `since_ts` is the admission boundary the TS
-- direct-rooms POST records.
-- `join_pending` splits 'accepted' into DECIDED vs JOINED: the console
-- records the decision, the invite poll performs the join and clears the
-- flag — so a refused join is retried next round (ADR-183: never
-- terminal) instead of being lost after one attempt.
