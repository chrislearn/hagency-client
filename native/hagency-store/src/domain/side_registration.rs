//! Project-side appservice registration issuing (task #13): the TS
//! `lib/appservice-receiver.js` `generateRegistration` +
//! `renderRegistrationYaml` pair and the `POST
//! /api/project-sides/:id/registration-file` behaviour behind them
//! (`backend-v2.js:10031-10168`), as one store-owned method — the CLI
//! (`hagency side-registration`) and the console route
//! (`console/side_registration.rs`) are both thin callers of it.
//!
//! TOKENS ARE RANDOM, NEVER DERIVED (the TS comment above
//! `generateRegistration`, ADR-014 decision 3): 32 random bytes per token
//! as hex, generated once, stored here. Nothing outside this module and
//! the private state directory ever sees them — `IssueSideRegistration`
//! returns fingerprints (sha256 hex, first 8), never a token.
//!
//! THE SERVICE READS THE STORED TOKEN WITHOUT HAND-PLACING FILES: the
//! acceptance requirement. When a credential becomes LIVE, its as-token is
//! persisted at `<state>/matrix.appservice_token` — exactly the path the
//! appservice profile reads at startup (`bootstrap/config.rs:646`,
//! `read(&state.join("matrix.appservice_token"), 4096)`) through the
//! store's private-file policy — and the full YAML at
//! `<state>/registrations/<side>.yaml` (0700 directory, 0600 file, like
//! TS's `$HAGENCY_RUNTIME_DIR/registrations`) for the operator's install
//! step. A STAGED reissue writes only the YAML: the live credential (and
//! so the token the service authenticates with) keeps working until a
//! verify proves the homeserver accepts the new one.
