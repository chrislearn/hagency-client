//! ADR-186 §B/§C: a used-up allocation pauses the agent; a top-up resumes it.
//!
//! The hold is a row, never an engagement state: the engagement stays
//! `active`, its running turn finishes, queued work stays queued, and the
//! claim simply does not pick a dispatch whose engagement holds one open
//! (`execution.rs` candidate predicate). Nothing is dropped, refused or
//! marked done (ADR-183: the bridge never decides done). The hold opens only
//! on KNOWN spend — host-attributed usage that reached the allocation — and
//! lifts the moment the allocation is above the spend again (a top-up) or the
//! spend stops being known. That makes host-attributed usage the trigger for
//! this one pause (§B5), and for nothing else: it never revokes, ends or
//! refuses an engagement.
