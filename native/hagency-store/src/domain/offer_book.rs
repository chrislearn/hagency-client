//! Requester-facing reads (board #48; TS `backend-v2.js:15283-15448`): the offer
//! book (`GET /api/offer-book`), the contributions list
//! (`GET /api/contributions`) and the engagement PREVIEW
//! (`GET /api/engagements/preview`) — the last a DRY RUN that decides nothing
//! and writes nothing.
//!
//! WHAT NATIVE HONESTLY HAS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. The retained product spreads
//! these three reads over three stores: `engagementStore.listOffers()` (offer
//! TERMS — `budgetCapPerEngagement`/`rateCap`/`count`), `engagementStore.
//! isWhitelisted()` (an auto-join allowlist) and `approvalStore.listBindings()`
//! (an agent<->project BINDING carrying a membership probe). Native has no
//! offer-terms table, no whitelist and no binding table — and it never
//! auto-joins: every engagement is born `pending` (`domain.rs`, `admit`) and only
//! an operator verdict moves it. Inventing a column would need a migration this
//! task forbids; inventing a value would be worse. So each read serves the REAL
//! state native holds and encodes what native lacks exactly as the retained store
//! encodes "unset"/"never checked":
//!
//!   * the offer book lists the REAL published roles and, per role, the REAL
//!     serving resource and resource list (`Resource::qualifies` +
//!     `qualification::resources_for_role`) and the REAL live count
//!     (`engagements`). The three cap fields are `None` — the retained store's own
//!     "unset" encoding (`lib/engagement-store.js:451-454`: an absent cap is
//!     `null`, never `0`).
//!   * `whitelisted` is `None` when no room was named (the retained route's own
//!     rule, `backend-v2.js:15323`, so a named-room claim is never made about a
//!     room nobody identified) and `Some(false)` when one was: native trusts no
//!     room for auto-join, which is not an accusation but the plain truth of an
//!     approval-only host.
//!   * contributions project the REAL agent<->project relationships native holds
//!     (live engagements joined to their project). The two membership-probe fields
//!     are `None` — the retained store's tri-state "never checked"
//!     (`lib/approval-store.js:327-328`, `agentJoined ?? null`), which is not
//!     `false` ("the agent is NOT in the room") and must not be collapsed into it.
//!   * the preview reads native's REAL resource headroom and answers with the
//!     route native would actually take — `notWhitelisted` — which is the whole
//!     point of a dry run: it reports the host's real default rather than the
//!     retained host's auto-join.
