//! TS oracle: `tests/api-engagement-room-admission.test.js`,
//! `tests/engagement-binding.test.js`, plus the room half of
//! `tests/approval-owner-can-see-it.test.js`.
//!
//! Ported into the MATRIX crate, whose existing harnesses own this surface:
//! the fake homeserver (`tests/common/mod.rs::Fake`), the physical room
//! operation (`tests/provision_rooms/mod.rs`, driven by `intake/provisioning.rs`)
//! and the approval delivery/intake suites.
//!
//! Native genuinely differs from TS in this area: native has no whitelist, no
//! offer terms and no `agent<->project` binding table, and every engagement is
//! born `pending` with an operator verdict — so the TS room-admission path
//! (`POST /api/engagements` auto-join, `/api/approvals` bindings) has no native
//! route. Cases whose observable outcome IS asserted natively are named as
//! `covered:`; cases with no native counterpart are `parity gap:`.
