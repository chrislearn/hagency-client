//! The agent-invite poller (task #12): the retained
//! `bridge-matrix.js:7894-8131` `pollAgentInvites`, as one background
//! task beside the sweeps — same `Shared` (collector + domain) the file
//! service and receive service use, same shutdown token.
//!
//! TRUST (`getRoomTrust` with `requireTrustedInviter`,
//! `bridge-matrix.js:2841-2851`): TS trusts an inviter pre-declared in
//! `MATRIX_TRUSTED_INVITER_MXIDS`. The store-held equivalent is the
//! owner the room's PROJECT recorded — provisioning wrote exactly that
//! owner (`projects.owner_mxid`), so an invitation from them takes the
//! trusted-inviter arm: join now, no operator round-trip. Anyone else —
//! including an inviter the invite state could not name (NULL, surfaced
//! never guessed, ADR-002) — becomes a PENDING DECISION at the console,
//! exactly the ADR-014 2026-08-11 amendment: joining spends the
//! contributor's tokens.
//!
//! THE BRIDGE NEVER DECIDES IT IS DONE: a join or leave the homeserver
//! refused stays on its worklist and is retried next round with the
//! poller's own backoff — never terminal, never a process kill
//! (ADR-183). A successful join settles any stale pending record as
//! `accepted` by `trusted-inviter` (the reconcile at
//! `bridge-matrix.js:7926-7945`: the agent is in the room, so the
//! invitation WAS answered — by policy, never credited to a person).
